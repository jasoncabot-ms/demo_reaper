# ðŸ’€ Demo Reaper ðŸ’€

Keeps your Azure subscription clear of expired resources

## Do you ...

* frequently spin up demo environments in Azure to showcase some particular functionality?
* forget to remove them, wasting both energy and money?

Me too.

## Introducing the Demo Reaper

The reaper will monitor your subscription and automatically end the life your demo resources without you having to take any action

Sound useful?

3. ???
4. Profit

## How does it work?

Any resource group created with `delete` in it's name will be culled 7 days after it was created without you having to take any manual action

A GitHub Action, with access to your subscription, will run every day and look for any resources that are past their expiry date. If it finds any, they will be culled.

## Can I change how long a resource group will be considered valid?

Yes - just add a tag called `delete` with an integer value for the number of days this resource group should be active.

For example this resource group called `app-service-delete` with tag `{delete: 3}` will be culled automatically **3 days** after it was created.

## How do I know if it worked?

Look in the GitHub actions log. A run where expired resources were found would look something like this:

Otherwise if no expired resources were found, then something like this:
